"""Boundary padding and sliding-window inference utilities (pure torch).

Mechanics mirror nnU-Net v2's verified inference pipeline:

- inputs are padded with constant zeros (``pad_nd_image(..., 'constant', 0)``),
  centered, and the padding is reverted on the output;
- tile offsets follow ``compute_steps_for_sliding_window``: first tile at 0,
  last tile flush with the far edge, remaining tiles spread evenly;
- overlapping tile logits are blended with a Gaussian importance map
  (``sigma = tile * 1/8``, scaled to max 10, clamped away from zero) and
  accumulated in float32.

Everything here is layout-native NCHW ``[B, C, H, W]``; the BHWC port contract
lives in the node wrapper.

    float32, divides, and crops the padding back off. Runs under ``no_grad`` —
    this is an inference path, not a training path.

    ``weight_map`` lets the caller pass a cached Gaussian (``[1, 1, th, tw]``);
    when ``None`` and ``gaussian`` is set, one is built on the fly.

    ``amp`` runs each tile's forward under ``torch.autocast`` (fp16) when ``x`` is
    on CUDA — matching nnU-Net's inference path; it is a no-op on CPU. Logits are
    cast back to float32 for the accumulation regardless.

    ``tile_batch`` is how many tiles are stacked into a single ``net`` call. The
    default ``1`` reproduces the original one-tile-per-forward behaviour exactly.
    A 128px tile barely occupies a modern GPU, so processing tiles one at a time
    is launch/underfill bound; batching packs several tiles onto the batch axis so
    each kernel does more work. It changes utilisation, not the result: the tiles,
    weights and accumulation are identical, so outputs match the serial path to
    floating-point tolerance. Higher values trade GPU memory for speed.
